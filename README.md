# NCCU-Labor-Economics

This course was taught by Professor Po-Chun Huang.

The following information is extracted from the syllabus:

This course has two goals: to develop economic analyses of changes that have occurred (and are now occurring) in labor markets, and to provide a survey of basic empirical facts and evidence about work and pay. Throughout the course, we will discuss data and methods used by labor economists to understand labor markets. Participants are expected to write a high-quality research proposal that will hopefully lead to a research paper.
